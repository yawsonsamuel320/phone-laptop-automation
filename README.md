Existing Gaps (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16150):
* Vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization
* Adaptive learning beyond static prompting
* Effective planning and reasoning methods and models
* Benchmarks that refelct real-world task complexity
* Standardized evaluation based on task success
* Aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints
